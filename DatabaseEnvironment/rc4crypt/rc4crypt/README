INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(1) Un (tar/zip) the rc4crypt.(tar/zip) file
(2) Read the gpl.txt
(3) Look at the rc4test.php, should be self explanatory

Now, a few points to note:

	(A) Try to pass keys as hexadecimal as much as possible, also don't forget
	    to put $ispwdHex = 1 if you do.

	(B) All data passed to the functions, should be what you exactly want to encrypt
	    and any data you want to decrypt, should be data send back directly from the
	    encrypt function. Beware of urlencoding/urldecoding

	(C) AND more importantly worry about magic_quotes in your code! I've put
	    the magic quotes check just in case
